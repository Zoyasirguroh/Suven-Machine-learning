Steps to make your PC quickly ready for Machine Learning course

1> Don't download Anaconda. Its too heavy. So many packages are never needed.

2> You have installed Python 3.6 , if not do it from this link.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/
// Higher versions of Python would do. 

3> Ensure you are able to run Python from the command line, like;
python --version

4> Ensure pip, set-up-tools, and wheel are up to date
While pip alone is sufficient to install from pre-built binary archives, up to date copies of the setuptools and wheel projects are useful to ensure you can also install from source archives:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

5> Using pip , install the following packages / modules :
pip install pandas
[ Word of caution : if you get an error : "pip not recognized as an internal or external command" then pip installer is not installed ]
[ Solution : do this :
  // Installing Pip
  python get-pip.py
 // Check pip version
  pip -V 
  
// Fine, now continue installing all packages/ modules.   
pip install sklearn
pip install numpy
pip install warnings
pip install os
pip install datetime
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-image
pip install scikit-datasets
pip install scipy
pip install pytz
pip install nltk
pip install seaborn
